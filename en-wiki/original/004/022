[ 6 ] [ 9 ] 1991–95: Age Ain't Nothing but a Number and marriage After Hankerson signed a distribution deal with Jive Records , he signed Aaliyah to his Blackground Records label at the age of 12. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Hankerson later introduced her to recording artist and producer R. Kelly , [ 9 ] who became Aaliyah's mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of the album, which was recorded when she was 14.

[ 19 ] Age Ain't Nothing But a Number received generally favorable reviews from music critics . Some writers noted that Aaliyah's "silky vocals" and "sultry voice" blended with Kelly's new jack swing helped define R&B in the 1990s. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Her sound was also compared to that of female quartet En Vogue . [ 20 ] [ 22 ] Christopher John Farley of Time magazine described the album as a "beautifully restrained work", noting that Aaliyah's "girlish, breathy vocals rode calmly on R. Kelly's rough beats". [ 23 ] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic felt that the album had its "share of filler", but described the singles as "slyly seductive". [ 1 ] He also claimed that the songs on the album were "frequently better" than that of Kelly's second studio album, 12 Play . [ 1 ] With the release of Age Ain't Nothing but a Number , rumors circulated of a relationship between Aaliyah and R. Kelly .

[ 6 ] The album yielded the single " If Your Girl Only Knew ", which topped the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for two weeks. [ 18 ] It also generated the singles " Hot like Fire " and " 4 Page Letter ". The following year, Aaliyah was featured on Timbaland & Magoo 's debut single, " Up Jumps da Boogie ". [ 30 ] One in a Million peaked at number 18 on the Billboard 200 , [ 15 ] selling over 3.7 million copies in the United States and over eight million copies worldwide. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] The album was certified double platinum by the RIAA on June 16, 1997, denoting shipments of two million copies. [ 16 ] Aaliyah attended the Detroit High School for the Performing Arts , where she majored in drama and graduated in 1997. [ 9 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Aaliyah began her acting career that same year; she played herself in the police drama television series New York Undercover . [ 35 ] During this time, Aaliyah participated in the Children's Benefit Concert, a charity concert that took place at the Beacon Theatre in New York. [ 36 ] Aaliyah also became the spokesperson for Tommy Hilfiger Corporation .

" was featured on the Dr. Dolittle soundtrack , which earned Aaliyah her first Grammy Award nomination. [ 41 ] The song peaked at number 21 on the Hot 100. [ 42 ] 2000–01: Romeo Must Die and eponymous album In 2000, Aaliyah landed her first major movie role in Romeo Must Die . Aaliyah starred opposite martial artist Jet Li , playing a couple who fall in love amid their warring families. It grossed US$18.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number two at the box office. [ 43 ] In addition to acting, Aaliyah served as an executive producer of the film soundtrack , where she contributed four songs. [ 44 ] " Try Again " was released as a single from the soundtrack; the song topped the Billboard Hot 100 , making Aaliyah the first artist to top the chart based solely on airplay ; this led the song to be released in a 12" vinyl and 7" single . [ 18 ] [ 45 ] The music video won the Best Female Video and Best Video from a Film awards at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards . [ 46 ] It also earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocalist. [ 47 ] The soundtrack went on to sell 1.5 million copies in the United States.

[ 9 ] [ 49 ] Her the third and final studio album, Aaliyah , was released on July 17, 2001, under Blackground and Virgin Records . Preparation for the album started in 1998 but, with the filming of martial arts film Romeo Must Die (2000), Aaliyah postponed the recording of the album. Artists Timbaland and Missy Elliott , who were both major contributors on previous album One in a Million , were involved in disagreements with Aaliyah's label Blackground Records at the time and did not work on the project. Blackground owner Barry Hankerson envisioned another label similar to Bad Boy on the West Coast , and consulted lesser known writers and producers signed to his publishing company. These artists included Bud'da , Jeffrey "J-Dub" Walker, and Rapture , and E. Seats of Keybeats. [ 50 ] Stephen "Static Major" Garrett of the R&B trio Playa , who had written the Aaliyah's previous singles " Are You That Somebody? and " Try Again ", became involved in the project. [ 50 ] Much of the album was completed in various studios throughout New York City prior to Aaliyah's trip to Australia for the filming of Queen of the Damned (2002). [ 50 ] While recording process lasted more than a year, most of the tracks were completed by early 2000, when the production team and songwriters had secured recording time at New York Sound King Studios to work on the album together. [ 50 ] In September 2000, Virgin Records flew the group out to Australia, where it spent a month recording the majority of the album at the Sing Sing Studio in Melbourne with Aaliyah. [ 50 ] With three recording studios going simultaneously, producers J-Dub, Bud’da and Keybeats each worked in separate rooms. [ 50 ] During the sessions, Garrett and co-writer Digital Black would move from studio to studio to check each producer's progress. [ 50 ] At peak periods, they would work on 10 songs at the same time. [ 50 ] With filming ending in Australia in December 2000, production of the album went into full-force in America and Europe. The first single, " We Need a Resolution ", featured Timbaland and was released in late April in the United States. The song reached number fifty nine on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the issue dated June 9, 2001, and remained on the chart for sixteen weeks.

The music video was premiered on Much More Music , Black Entertainment Television 's (BET) 106 & Park and MTV 's TRL on April 26, 2001. " Rock the Boat ", the second single, was released in early August. Aaliyah started promotion for the expected second single "More Than a Woman", but the single was pushed back because her label felt "Rock the Boat" was a summer single that needed to be released. "Rock the Boat" was the second single in America while and the third single internationally. On the Billboard Hot 100, the song entered the chart September 8, 2001, at number fifty-seven [ 51 ] and peaked at number 14 in its twelfth week. [ 52 ] The song stayed on the chart for twenty-five weeks. [ 53 ] The third single, " More Than a Woman ," was released in November 2001. Promotion for the single started in July 2001 but was pushed back. In the Billboard Hot 100, the song entered the chart dated issue February 2, 2002, at number seventy-one [ 54 ] and peaked at number twenty-five in its ninth week. [ 55 ] The song stayed in the chart for twenty-four weeks. [ 56 ] The song ranked fifty-eighth on the 2002 year-end chart. [ 57 ] On January 13, 2002, the song became Aaliyah's only number one hit in the United Kingdom , selling 32,081 copies for that week. It became the first time in UK chart history that a posthumous release had taken over from another posthumous release when the song was replaced by George Harrison 's " My Sweet Lord ", and the first time that a woman had a posthumous number one single. All together, the single has sold 347,563 copies in the United Kingdom. The song reached the top twenty in Ireland and Switzerland . " I Refuse ", the fourth single (France only), was released as a double A-side single along with "More Than a Woman". "I Refuse" was a moderate hit, peaking in at 12 it's first week in the top 30 in France. " I Care 4 U ", the fifth single (US only), was released on Mother's Day 2002. It managed to reach number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number three on Billboard' s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. [ 18 ] Although the single was only released in the U.S., the song achieved minor airplay on R&B stations in Europe. Aaliyah entered the US Billboard 200 and the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums at number two, with 190,000 copies sold in the first week.

As a percentage of sales increased 800%, making the biggest increase in sales in history. [ 60 ] [ 16 ] [ 61 ] The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America , for shipments of 2,000,000 copies in the US. [ 16 ] It also became the third album from Aaliyah to receive the award of multi-platinum. [ 16 ] The album has sold more 2.95 million copies in the US. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] The album spent 188 weeks on the Billboard 200, making it one of the longest stays in the Billboard 200 albums chart. The record has since been surpassed by Taylor Swift , whose self-titled first album stayed for 189 weeks. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Physical copies of the album are out of print in the United States , but there have been rumors that the album is scheduled for a special edition tenth anniversary re-release in 2011 [ citation needed ] . It is available for download in iTunes . The album debuted at number two on the charts worldwide, with more than 330,000 copies sold. In the week of her death the album rose from number 25 to number 1, with more than 888,000 copies sold. [ 16 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Until the release of I Care 4 U (December 2002), the album had sold in excess of 9 million copies worldwide. [ 16 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] As of December 2008 , the album sold more than 13 million copies worldwide (12 million physical copies and 1 million downloads via the Internet ). The album is Aaliyah's highest-selling in the world. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 14 ] Death On August 25, 2001, at 6:45 pm ( EST ), Aaliyah and various members of the record company boarded a twin-engine Cessna 402 B ( registration N8097W) at the Marsh Harbour Airport in Abaco Islands , The Bahamas, to travel to the Opa-locka Airport in Florida, after they completed filming the music video for the single " Rock the Boat ". [ 70 ] They had a flight scheduled the following day, but with filming finishing early, Aaliyah and her entourage were eager to return to the United States and made the decision to leave immediately. The designated airplane was smaller than the Cessna 404 in which they had originally flown. The whole party and all of the equipment were accommodated on board. [ 71 ] As a result, when the aircraft attempted to depart, it was over its maximum takeoff weight by 700 pounds (320 kg) and was carrying one excess passenger, according to its certification. [ 72 ] The plane crashed shortly after takeoff, about 200 feet (60 m) from the runway. [ 70 ] Aaliyah and the eight others on board, pilot Luis Morales III, hair stylist Eric Forman, Anthony Dodd, security guard Scott Gallin, video producer Douglas Kratz, stylist Christopher Maldonado, and Blackground Records employees Keith Wallace and Gina Smith, were all killed. [ 73 ] According to findings from an inquest, conducted by the coroner's office in The Bahamas, Aaliyah suffered from "severe burns and a blow to the head", in addition to severe shock and a weak heart. [ 74 ] The coroner theorized that, even if Aaliyah had survived the crash, her recovery would have been virtually impossible given the severity of her injuries. [ 75 ] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report stated that "the airplane was seen lifting off the runway, and then nose down, impacting in a marsh on the south side of the departure end of runway 27 and then exploding in flames." [ 76 ] It indicated that the pilot was not approved to pilot the plane he was attempting to fly. Morales falsely obtained his Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license by showing hundreds of hours never flown, and he may also have falsified how many hours he had flown in order to get a job with his employer, Blackhawk International Airways. [ 77 ] Additionally, an autopsy performed on Morales revealed traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system. [ 78 ] The NTSB reported that the maximum allowed gross weight of the plane was "substantially exceeded" and that the center of gravity was positioned beyond its rear limit. [ 76 ] John Frank of the Cessna Pilots Association stated that the plane was "definitely overloaded". [ 79 ] Funeral and wrongful death lawsuit The entrance to Ferncliff Cemetery , where Aaliyah is interred in a crypt Aaliyah's funeral was held on August 31, 2001, at the Saint Ignatius Loyola Church in New York. Her body was set in a silver casket , which was carried in a glass hearse and was drawn by horse. [ 80 ] An estimated 800 mourners were in attendance of the procession. [ 12 ] [ 81 ] Among those in attendance at the private ceremony were Missy Elliott , Timbaland , Gladys Knight , Lil' Kim and Sean Combs . [ 80 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] After the service, 22 white doves were released to symbolize each year of Aaliyah's life. [ 84 ] She was interred in a crypt in a private room in the Rosewood Mausoleum at the Ferncliff Cemetery . [ 85 ] The day of the crash was Morales' first official day with Blackhawk International Airways, an FAA Part 135 single-pilot operation. Morales was not registered with the FAA to fly for Blackhawk. As a result of the accident, Aaliyah's parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company, which was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. [ 86 ] Barry & Sons, Inc., a corporation formed in 1992 to develop, promote and capitalize Aaliyah and to oversee the production and distribution of her records and music videos, brought an unsuccessful lawsuit in the New York Supreme Court against Instinct Productions LLC, the company that was hired in August 2001 to produce the music video for "Rock the Boat". The case was dismissed because of New York's wrongful death statute only permitting certain people to recover damages for wrongful death. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Aftermath 2001–11: I Care 4 U , canceled film roles and Ultimate Aaliyah The week after Aaliyah's death, her third studio album, Aaliyah , rose from number 19 to number one on the Billboard 200 . [ 58 ] " Rock the Boat " was released as a posthumous single. The music video premiered on BET's Access Granted ; it became the most viewed and highest rated episode in the history of the show. [ 89 ] The song peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. [ 90 ] It was also included on the Now That's What I Call Music! 8 compilation series; a portion of the album's profits was donated to the Aaliyah Memorial Fund. [ 91 ] The following two singles from Aaliyah , " More than a Woman " and " I Care 4 U ", peaked within the top 25 of the Billboard Hot 100. [ 90 ] The album was certified double Platinum by the RIAA and sold 2.95 million copies in the United States. [ 16 ] [ 92 ] [ 65 ] "More than a Woman" reached number one in the UK singles chart making Aaliyah the first deceased artist to reach number one in the UK single chart. [ 93 ] "More than a Woman" was replaced by George Harrison 's "My Sweet Lord" which is the only time in the UK singles chart history where a dead artist has replaced another dead artist at number one. [ 94 ] She won two posthumous awards at the American Music Awards of 2002 ; Favorite Female R&B Artist and Favorite R&B/Soul Album for Aaliyah . [ 95 ] Her second and final film, Queen of the Damned , was released in February 2002. Before its release, Aaliyah's brother, Rashad, re-dubbed some of her lines during post-production. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] It grossed US$15.2 million in its first weekend, ranking number one at the box office. [ 98 ] On the first anniversary of Aaliyah's death, a candlelight vigil was held in Times Square , where millions of fans observed a moment of silence . Throughout the United States, radio stations played her music in remembrance. [ 99 ] In December 2002, a collection of previously unreleased material was released as Aaliyah's first posthumous album, I Care 4 U . A portion of the proceeds was donated to the Aaliyah Memorial Fund, a program that benefits the Revlon UCLA Women Cancer Research Program and Harlem's Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. [ 100 ] It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 , selling 280,000 copies in its first week. [ 101 ] The album's lead single, " Miss You ", peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. [ 90 ] In August of the following year, clothing retailer Christian Dior donated profits from sales in honor of Aaliyah. [ 102 ] Aaliyah was signed to appear in several future films, including Honey (recast to Jessica Alba ). [ 103 ] Some Kind of Blue and a Whitney Houston -produced remake of the 1976 film Sparkle were canceled due to Aaliyah's death. [ 3 ] [ 104 ] Before her death, Aaliyah had filmed part of her role in The Matrix Reloaded and was scheduled to appear in The Matrix Revolutions as Zee . [ 30 ] The role was later recast to Nona Gaye . [ 49 ] Aaliyah's scenes were later included in the tribute section of the Matrix Ultimate Collection series. [ 105 ] In 2005, Aaliyah's second compilation album, Ultimate Aaliyah was released in the UK by Blackground Records. [ 106 ] Ultimate Aaliyah is a three disc set, which included a greatest hits audio CD and a DVD. [ 106 ] Andy Kellman of Allmusic remarked " Ultimate Aaliyah adequately represents the shortened career of a tremendous talent who benefited from some of the best songwriting and production work by Timbaland, Missy Elliott, and R. Kelly." [ 106 ] A documentary movie Aaliyah Live in Amsterdam was released in 2011., shortly before the tenth anniversary of Aaliyah's death. The documentary, by Pogus Caesar , contained previously unseen footage shot of her career beginnings in 1995 when she was appearing in the Netherlands. [ 107 ] 2012–present: Second posthumous album In 2012 music producer Jeffrey "J-Dub" Walker via twitter said "Just got great news today; the smash unreleased song called "Steady Ground" I produced on #Aaliyah is gonna be on her upcoming album:)". Walker co-wrote "I Refuse" and "What if" from Aaliyah's third self-titled album and produced the song "Steady Ground" for her 'One in a Million' album. This second proposed posthumous album would feature this song using demo vocals since Walker claims the originals were somehow lost by his sound engineer. However, Walker's original tweet announcing this event has since been removed, and Aaliyah's brother, via Twitter, has stated that "no official album [is] being released and supported by the Haughton family." [ 108 ] Artistry Voice and timbre "More Than a Woman" (2001) As her albums progressed, music critics felt that Aaliyah had matured, noting a "near-flawless declaration of strength and independence". [ 109 ] Problems listening to this file? See media help . Aaliyah had a vocal range of a soprano . [ 9 ] With the release of her debut single " Back & Forth ", Dimitri Ehrlich of Entertainment Weekly expressed that Aaliyah's "silky vocals are more agile than those of self-proclaimed queen of hip-hop soul Mary J. Blige ." [ 110 ] Aaliyah described her sound as "street but sweet", which featured her "gentle" vocals over a "hard" beat . [ 111 ] Though Aaliyah did not write any of her own material, [ 9 ] her lyrics were described as in-depth. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] She incorporated R&B , pop and hip hop into her music. [ 6 ] [ 114 ] Her songs were often uptempo and melancholy , revolving around "matters of the heart". [ 115 ] Her songs have been said to have "crisp production" and "staccato arrangements" that "extend genre boundaries" while containing "old-school" soul music . When she experimented with other genres, such as Latin pop and heavy metal , critics panned the attempt. [ 115 ] As her albums progressed, writers felt that Aaliyah matured, calling her progress a "declaration of strength and independence". [ 109 ] [ 113 ] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described her eponymous album, Aaliyah , as "a statement of maturity and a stunning artistic leap forward" and called it one of the strongest urban soul records of its time. [ 113 ] She portrayed "unfamiliar sounds, styles and emotions", but managed to please critics with the contemporary sound it contained. [ 113 ] Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone felt that Aaliyah reflected a stronger technique, where she gave her best vocal performance. [ 116 ] Others felt that she was "satisfying rather than extraordinary", stating that she added little to modern R&B. [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Musical style and image As an artist, Aaliyah often voiced that she was inspired by a number of performers. These include Michael Jackson , Stevie Wonder , Sade , En Vogue , Nine Inch Nails , Korn , Prince , Naughty by Nature , Johnny Mathis and Janet Jackson . [ 119 ] Aaliyah expressed that Michael Jackson's Thriller was her "favorite album" and that "nothing will ever top Thriller ." [ 119 ] She stated that she admired Sade because "she stays true to her style no matter what... she's an amazing artist, an amazing performer... and I absolutely love her." [ 119 ] Aaliyah expressed she had always desired to work with Janet Jackson, whom she had drawn frequent comparison to over the course of her career, stating "I admire her a great deal. She's a total performer... I'd love to do a duet with Janet Jackson." [ 119 ] [ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ] Jackson reciprocated Aaliyah's affections, commenting "I've loved her from the beginning because she always comes out and does something different, musically." Jackson also stated she would have enjoyed collaborating with Aaliyah. [ 119 ] Aaliyah focused on her public image throughout her career. She often wore baggy clothes and sunglasses, stating that she wanted to be herself. [ 123 ] She described her image as being "important… to differentiate yourself from the rest of the pack". [ 124 ] She often wore black clothing, starting a trend for similar fashion among women in United States and Japan. [ 9 ] [ 125 ] Aaliyah participated in fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger 's All America Tour and was featured in Tommy Jean ads, which depicted her in boxer shorts , baggy jeans and a tube top . Hilfiger's brother, Andy , called it "a whole new look" that was "classy but sexy". [ 125 ] When she changed her hairstyle, Aaliyah took her mother's advice to cover her left eye, much like Veronica Lake . [ 126 ] In 1998, she hired a personal trainer to keep in shape, and exercised five days a week and ate diet foods . [ 127 ] Aaliyah was praised for her "clean-cut image" and "moral values". [ 128 ] Legacy Aaliyah has been credited for helping redefine R&B and hip hop in the 1990s, "leaving an indelible imprint on the music industry as a whole." [ 112 ] [ 129 ] Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote Aaliyah ranks among the "elite" artists of the R&B genre, as she "played a major role in popularizing the stuttering, futuristic production style that consumed hip-hop and urban soul in the late '90s." [ 130 ] Described as one of "R&B's most important artists" during the 1990s, [ 131 ] her second studio album, One in a Million , became one of the most influential R&B albums of the decade. [ 28 ] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , Aaliyah provided a "missing link" between hip hop and electronica . [ 132 ] With sales of 8.1 million albums in the United States and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide, [ 133 ] [ 134 ] [ 135 ] Aaliyah earned the nicknames "Princess of R&B" and "Queen of Urban Pop", [ 136 ] [ 137 ] as she "proved she was a muse in her own right". [ 138 ] Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone dubbed her as the "undisputed queen of the midtempo come-on". [ 11 ] Japanese pop singer Hikaru Utada has said several times that "It was when I heard Aaliyah's Age Ain't Nothing But a Number that I got hooked on R&B.", after which Utada released her debut album First Love with heavy R&B influences. [ 139 ] Aaliyah was honored at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards by Janet Jackson , Missy Elliott , Timbaland , Ginuwine and her brother, Rashad, who all paid tribute to her. [ 140 ] In the same year, the United States Social Security Administration ranked the name Aaliyah one of the 100 most popular names for newborn girls. [ 141 ] Aaliyah was ranked as one of "The Top 40 Women of the Video Era" in VH1 's 2003 The Greatest series. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] She was also ranked at number 18 on BET's "Top 25 Dancers of All Time". [ 144 ] Aaliyah appeared on both 2000 and 2001 list of Maxim Hot 100 in position 41 and the latter at 14. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] In memory of Aaliyah, the Entertainment Industry Foundation created the Aaliyah Memorial Fund to donate money raised to charities she supported. [ 147 ] [ 148 ] In December 2009, Billboard magazine ranked Aaliyah at number 70 on its Top Artists of the Decade, [ 149 ] while her eponymous album was ranked at number 181 on the magazine's Top 200 Albums of the Decade. [ 150 ] She is listed by Billboard as the tenth most successful female R&B artist of the past 25 years, and 27th most successful R&B artist overall.
